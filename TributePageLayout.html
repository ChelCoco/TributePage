      <p> Gertrudis was a tough and bold woman who fought for the mexican war of independence. Unlike most women of her time,
        she had the opportunity to read books, one of them was the Age of Enlightment. Once war broke out, she joined the
        ant-royalist forces with her husband and son. She carried out communications between the town of Patzcuaro and Tacambaro.
        She was a messenger for two rebel strongholds and a target for royal forces. On 1817, she was captured and tortured.
        She never gave any information about her fellow revolutionaries. Today she's honored in her home town and her war
        efforts have not been forgotten.</p>
